<p>Sometimes you should ask yourself, why you need to do the same thing everyday when there’s a new bridge to shorten the path. Think of a framework as a bridge that will help you code faster and easier. Did you notice I didn’t include the word “better” in the last sentence? Faster and easier doesn’t always mean better, but we will get to that later.</p>

<p>
  Efficiency
Tasks that usually would take you hours and hundreds of lines of code to write, can now be done in minutes with pre-built functions. Development becomes a lot easier, so if it’s easier it’s faster, and consequently efficient.
Security
A widely used framework has big security implementations. The big advantage is the community behind it, where users become long-term testers. If you find a vulnerability or a security hole, you can go to the framework’s website and let the team know so they can fix it.
Cost
Most popular frameworks are free, and since it also helps the developer to code faster, the cost for the final client will be smaller.
Support
As any other distributed tool, a framework usually comes with documentation, a support team, or big community forums where you can obtain quick answers.</p>
